  Step 2. To enjoy our parties up-to-date, our page will be up-to-date everytime for the clients<br>
  Step 3. There will be a chance that the clients can register online. <br>
  Step 4. As the prices of the clothes will be shown down, the clients will also have a chance to bring enough money to the show to buy their favourite costumes.</p>
